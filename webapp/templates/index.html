      <p>In one survey of university students at a particular institution, almost half of respondents indicated at least one place where they felt marginalized or excluded. Belongr is here to change that.</p>
      <p>Belongr is a web application for email-verified university students to anonymously see and rate the levels of inclusivity of university-recognized student organizations on their campus in the context of identities such as race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, and disability. For each university-recognized student organization, Belongr provides for each identity a histogram of inclusivity ratings and their mean, median, and mode as well as the number of ratings. This information does not go public until a club has at least 30 ratings.</p>
