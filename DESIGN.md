To create Belongr, we utilized a technical stack comprised of: Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Numpy, and MatPlotLib. 

Belongr is a simple webapp. Therefore, it made sense to use the traditional stack of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. As learned in class, Flask can add dynamism to any webapp and in the case of Belongr with multiple pages, specifically pages dependent on whether a user was logged in or not, Flask and its ability to render templates were useful for streamlining the development of Belongr and maximizing functionality.

Additionally, processing data and presenting of it to the user is central function of Belongr. Through Flask-powered forms, users would be able to rate clubs and their corresponding inclusivity on markers like race, gender, and more. Numpy allowed a way to process this user-provided data. MatPlotLib was then able to pick up where Numpy left off, processing the data further and generating histograms based on the user's ratings. These technologies also worked seamlessly with our database of club inclusivity based in SQL.
