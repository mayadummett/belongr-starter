To create Belongr, we utilized a technical stack comprised of: Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Numpy, and MatPlotLib. 

Belongr is a webapp. Therefore, it's reasonable to use the traditional stack of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 

As learned in class, Flask can add incredible dynamism to any webapp. Belongr has a number of pages. The ability of a user to view pages such as "Your Ratings" or "Change Password" is dependent on whether a user has an account with Belongr, whether they are logged in, and the like. Flask and its ability to render templates with backend logic is useful for streamlining the creation and display of these pages, effectively streamlining the development of Belongr and maximizing functionality simutaneously.

Furthermore, processing data and presenting of it to the user is a central function of Belongr. Through Flask-powered forms, users are be able to rate clubs and their corresponding inclusivity on markers like race, gender, and more. Numpy allows a way to process this user-provided data. MatPlotLib is then able to pick up where Numpy left off, processing the data further by generating histograms based on the user's ratings. These technologies also worked seamlessly with our database of club inclusivity markers based in SQL.
